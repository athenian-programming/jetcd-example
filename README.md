[etcd-recipes](https://github.com/pambrose/etcd-recipes) is a Kotlin/Java/JVM client library 
for [etcd](https://etcd.io) v3, a distributed, reliable key-value store. It attempts to provide the same 
kind of support for [etcd](https://etcd.io) that 
[Curator](https://curator.apache.org) does for [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org).


## Compatability
etcd-recipes is built on top of [jetcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/jetcd), which works with etcd v3.

etcd-recipies is written in Kotlin, but is usable by Java and any other JVM clients.
